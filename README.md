This is a simple implementation of Google's Dinosaur game implementation in URL bar (address bar of browser). Though the game is still in development status, the basic game itself is only 28 KB!

Most of us have used Chrome in some point of our life, be it's on desktop / laptop or in smartphones, but one thing that most of us came across is that, when the network connection is down i.e. in offline state, when we tried surfing on Chrome, most of us have got to play - "Google Dinosaur game" . It's a brilliant game made by the Chromium devs, looks simple enough and is practically embedded in all (updated) Chrome browsers. Now, I someday thought that why not make this game playable in the URL address bar itself, & that's how 'URL-Dinogame' was born, basically taking it's name as the 'lite' version of the Chrome Dinosaur game. The game is made with simple HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript, & the code can be found in the given link above. It's UI is still in development status though, but it's playable! Just git clone the repo and run it in your local. That's it! For future improvement, I am looking forward to making a PWA of it and also adding reactive UI elements to make it look attractive :)
